# Nebulae Classification Using Transfer Learning

This tool was created to assist in the task of nebulae classification using the deep learning library TensorFlow coupled with a powerful image classification technique known as transfer learning.

## Setup and Installation

Begin by cloning the directory to the desired directory on your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bansailboat/nebula-classifier
```

It would be best to create a new environment to run the code. With conda, you can run:
```bash
conda create --name <env> --file requirements.txt
```
...passing in the desired name of the conda environment in place of <env>
